This installer does several things, which are all optional. You can:
  - update the Linux system
  - install SSH and enable it on port 22
  - install the Golem Provider node
  - add the provider process as a service, so that it starts when the machine is booted
  - start the service
  - install Netdata, a free, open source system monitoring tool. More info at https://www.netdata.cloud/
  - launch Firefox and open the Netdata dashboard, if installed
  - continuously monitor the status of the provider node
Installation is a snap. Just download the GolemDeploy.sh script, copy it to your Linux node and run it by opening a terminal and typing "./GolemProvider.sh". The script will handle the rest and walk you through each step.
